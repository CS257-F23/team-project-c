# PySpill

### Getting Started: ###
To get started using PySpill, run this command: 

`python3 pyspill.py lookup -l --state TX`

This will tell you how many pipline accidents have occured in the state
of Texas and the total cost of these accidents.

You can also run 

`python3 pyspill.py lookup -c "exxonmobil pipeline co"`

Which displays some summary statistics about a particular company.

Alternatively, run `python3 pyspill.py help` to get a full 
list of options.
