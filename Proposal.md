### Dataset Summary: 

We are using a dataset of oil pipeline spills across the US. The dataset includes rows like costs, locations, how much oil was spilled, and how much was cleaned up.

### Possible Features: 

- Look up statistics by company, sort by whatever column specified (state, cost, amount spilled) 
- Look up whether there has been a spill in a particular county/state, 
- Grade company on how bad they are
### Team Contract:

What are the goals of our team?
- Gain a deeper understanding of how front-end and back-end code interacts
- Spend adequate time on the pre-planning steps of the project to make sure we set ourselves up for success. 
- Create a product that is easy to interact with and provides interesting information

What are the strengths of our team and its members?
- James: I have experience with unit and end-to-end testing in a professional environment, using git/GitHub, and Unix and command line tools. I definitely have more experience with backend stuff, but I have done some HTML/CSS. 
- Feraidon: I have general experience with HTML/CSS, so my strength would be front end, but I’m happy to work on either side of development. 
- Paul: Good Python background. I believe I will be more helpful on the back-end development. 
- Henry: I have experience building front-end apps from databases, and from experience, I sometimes have good intuition on the feasibility of features, and good starting places for building certain features. I also have experience in UI design, which may come in handy when we start building our front end. 

How will we capitalize on the strengths of each member?
- Henry: I can be useful on either back/end or front-end stuff. In general, I’m very flexible, which might be useful.  
- James: I am also flexible and don’t mind being assigned to specific parts or doing miscellaneous tasks. I also think the way we capitalize on each other’s strengths will change as we learn more about everyone else and how we work together.
- Paul: I am more into backend but I have also a little bit of experience with design. I could be useful in that part too. 
- Feraidon: I can also be useful on all sides of development, I agree with James that this is something we can figure out more deeply once the technical challenges of the project are clear. 

What are the rules that will guide your team?
- *When will your team meet? What time, how often, for how long, and where?* We will meet in Olin. Times may vary from week to week but we will have at least a 30-minute check-in, weekly or more frequently as needed. We will also use virtual check-ins when needed. 
- *What roles will members take on in your meetings? Is someone responsible for setting agendas, taking notes, facilitating discussions, etc.?* At meetings, one person will always be responsible for taking notes, so we have a record of what was talked about. 
- *How will you communicate with each other? (to share work, to ask questions, notify the group if someone is running late or if someone will miss a meeting, etc)?* We will use a text group chat and email to communicate with each other. 
- *How will you make sure communication stays respectful? (How does your team define “respectful”?)* We define respectful communication as honest and open but not offensive or overly angry. We still want to keep things casual and fun (without being counterproductive!)
- *What are the rules for dealing with a teammate who hasn’t been communicating?* If a member hasn’t been communicating we will refer this member to look over this contract that they agreed to. Reminding them of the expectations we wrote together. 
- *How frequently should team members communicate/check in?* As soon as questions come up, and as progress is being made on features. We may also experiment with an async check-in system where members will note when they are checking to work on the project and what they are working on in a group chat. 
- *What technologies will you use to support team meetings and work?* (Google Drive, Hangouts, Zoom, Facetime, etc) We will use Google Drive, Zoom, FaceTime, and maybe Hangouts for communication. 
- *How will you make decisions? (Unanimous, consensus, majority rule, by assigned roles, rock-paper-scissors, etc.)* We will make group decisions by majority vote. However, when we are making decisions about specific work that one person has more experience in, that person’s opinion should be heavily considered. 
- *How will you divide the work?* As we go through the different steps of the project, we will discuss as a group how work will be divided. This is best left as a fluid process that can be determined on a week-by-week basis. 
- *How will you ensure that everybody participates meaningfully? How will you make sure that everyone’s contribution is valued?* To ensure that everybody participates meaningfully, we all will contractually agree to do the work we have set out to do. We also will strive to get members on features or parts of the project that they are passionate about, so everyone feels engaged. 
- *What expectations do you have for satisfactory participation? (How much time will each group member spend per week on project activities?)* Our group expectation is that all members complete the objectives assigned to them on time. If a member feels that their workload is too high, we expect them to communicate this to the rest of the group with ample time to re-divide. 
- *What process will you follow if someone does not live up to their responsibilities and/or meet the standards for work set by the team?* If a teammate is not living up to their responsibilities, we will be able to point to the objectives this member has not completed, to show that there has been a pattern of neglect. At this point, we could remind the member to look at this contract, and if needed, we could bring this problem to the attention of our professor if we feel it is something that is going to be exceedingly challenging to resolve. 
- *How will you address conflict or deal with disagreements within the team?* When conflicts or disagreements come up, we will agree to be respectful and have adequate group discussions. Hopefully, the majority rule agreement will help overcome any conflicts about project direction or features.
